# B-Team & New World Order Chummer Rules

A custom rules package for Chummer5 for the Shadowrun Edition 5 PnP RPG.

## Requirements

A working install of [Chummer5](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a).

## Installing

Download the latest zipped release [from here](https://github.com/glennpenridge/btnwo-custom-rules/releases).

Navigate your Chummer install directory and unzip the contents of the downloaded file to `customdata`.

Open Chummer and enable the custom data file by navigating to: `Tools > Options > Optional Rules`

Then check `NWO Optional Rules`.

Restart Chummer, and this time navigate to: `Tools > Options > Character Options`

Then check `B-Team/New World Order`.

At this point, you should be fine to apply these pieces of gear to your characters.

**MAKE SURE YOU KEEP A BACKUP OF YOUR CHARACTER(S) PRIOR TO ADDING ANY CUSTOM GEAR.**

_We don't know if we'll ever need to introduce breaking changes to this, so adding stuff to and from the data file could bust your character._

## Updates & Changes

Never modify the `master` branch directly; all changes should be added to an individual branch and then merged in via pull request.
